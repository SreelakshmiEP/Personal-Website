                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Sreelakshmi E P Veedu. I am curently pursuing my first year Btech in the department of Computer Science and 
                    Engineering in Government College of Engineering Kannur. I am a self motivated and result oriented Btech fresher 
                    looking for an oppurtunity in the field of technology to grow my skills and knowledge, which can further lead to the 
                    growth of the organization. I mainly believe that hard work really matters in our progress. Due to this belif, I was 
                    able to secure high rank in my entrance exam. I did my schooling in different schools in various countries which gave 
                    me a chance to know about their culture,language etc. My Strengths are confidence and commitment towards my work.
                    Talking about my interests and hobbies, I am a dancer. It is therapeutic to me as it helps me in releasing all my 
                    stress in seconds! I also like to catch up on reading in my free time. I also love to travel.</p>
